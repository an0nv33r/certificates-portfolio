# Certificates Portfolio

`Building knowledge, one certificate at a time: A portfolio of my ongoing learning and professional development.`

- This repository contains a collection of certificates I have earned from completing various courses, programs, and certifications. This portfolio serves as a record of my educational and professional accomplishments, and showcases my dedication to ongoing learning and personal development.

- I will continue to update and expand the portfolio as I earn additional certificates and complete new courses or programs.
